  "V1C0L6": "You need one deck of cards per team (5 to 7 people), a paper roll or a 1 x 2 m piece of paper, pencils, rubbers, colour felt tip pens and some tape.\n\n", 
  "V1C0L7": "The aim is for each team to place the cards in order on the table, find all the cause and effect relationships and draw arrows between the cards to illustrate what climate change is all about \n\n",
  "V1C0L8": "Deal the cards set by set and wait until all cards are down on the table before dealing the next set. \n\n", 
  "V1C0L9": "Time indications: one hour and a half to place the cards, half an hour to decoratethe Fresk and present the result then one hour to sit down together and discussthe solutions. \n\n",
  "V1C0L10": "For a simpler (or quicker) version of the game, take out cards #10, #14, #15 and/or #41, #42.",

  "V1C2L2": "The industry uses fossil fuels and electricity. It represents 40% of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.",

  "V1C3L2": "The use of buildings (housing and services) uses fossil fuels and electricity. This represents 20% of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.",
  "V1C4L1": "Transportation",
  "V1C4L2": "The transportation sector is highly dependent on oil. It represents 15% of greenhouse gas emissions.",
  "V1C5L1": "Fossil fuels",
  "V1C5L2": "Fossil fuels are coal, oil, and gas. They are mainly used in buildings, transportation, and industry. They emit CO2 when burned.",

  "V1C7L1": "CO2 emissions",
  "V1C7L2": "CO2 is the first anthropogenic greenhouse gas (i.e. emitted by humans). CO2 emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.",

  "V1C8L2": "Agriculture is responsible for emitting a little CO2 and a lot of methane (cows, rice fields), and nitrous oxide (fertilizers). All in all, it represents 25% of GHG emissions if deforestation is included.",
  "V1C9L1": "Other GHGs",
  "V1C9L2": "CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas. There are also methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (which come mostly from agriculture), as well as a few others.",
